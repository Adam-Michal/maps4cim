# Bugs and Features

## Known Limitations

* No rivers / water above 0m
* No reliefs above +61째 und below -60째 latitude, some small gaps in between

## Known Issues

* Overlap at -180째, 180째 -> not possible, Overpass rejects requests
* Broken Polygons (mostly when relations are involved)
* Missing support for multi-polygons
* Interpolation of gaps in SRTM dataset sometimes creates ugly results
* Incomplete color support


## Ideas for Future Releases

* HeightScale: auto
* Switch Renderer to support complex relation types and more
* Load custom OSM XML Files
* Load custom image files (ground texture & elevation)
* Do not write File output immediately -> temporaray result & interfaces for later changes
* Relief-Changeset based on OpenStreetMap data (e.g. for rivers)
* Analyze Prefix: Name, Date, Map-thumb, ...
* Support for some Relation types within OSM data
  - multipolygon (inner/outer)
* Improved interpolation of missing relief data
* Parallelize (has some potential ;))

### TODO-List

* gui: restore relief/texture enabled/disabled
* Global log-level switch (verbose, default, off would be nice -> warnings are always shown!)
* Make XML schema-aware!
* Cleanup code
* Write unit tests, where appropriate
